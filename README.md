Based on the analysis, proposing areas where the bank can enhance its positive response rate.

- Focus on customers aged 18-25, as this group is more likely to subscribe.
- Married individuals tend to respond better than single customers.
- Target campaigns between May, July, June and August, as response rates are higher during this period.
- Focus on mid-week (Tuesday, Saturday, Sunday and Friday ) for better engagement.

**Communication strategies :**
- Tailor calls and offers based on customer data, addressing them by name to create a personal connection.
- Reach customers at peak times (afternoon) and use follow-up calls or SMS reminders to boost engagement.
- Complement phone calls with email and SMS for better reach and reinforcement of the message.

**Response of term deposit campaign is not success.**
- Needs to be improvisation in communication with the customers.
- Needs to be Improve with contact category like “ Emails, Social media, SMS etc. ”
